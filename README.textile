h1. Cake DJJob Plugin

Quick and easy job queues, based on delayed_job

h2. Background

"CakePackages":http://github.com/josegonzalez/cakepackages is the type of site that would do well with background processes. Rather than try to build - and fail - a job/worker system, I set out to wrap an existing system.

I am aware of a few plugins for cakephp, notably the "queue":https://github.com/davidpersson/queue plugin by David Persson, and the "cron-mailer":https://github.com/kalt/cron-mailer plugin by Pierre-Emmanuel Fringant. However, I don't wish to run and maintain yet another service, and my cron tasks aren't email-based at all. The other thing was the lack of documentation for David's plugin, and I am hesitant to familiarize myself with so many tools at once.

At "SeatGeek":http://seatgeek.com, we use a "PHP port":http://github.com/seatgeek/djjob of "delayed_job":https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job, which works very well in production. It's a neat little set of classes that abstracts away most of the pain of creating new jobs and workers. Unfortunately, the only system I've ever used it in was Symfony (you'll notice we include a sample Symfony task with the package).

So here this is, Cake DJJob. Use it and abuse it to create Jobs/workers whenever necessary :)

h2. Usage

h3. Creating New Jobs

You can create new jobs in the @libs/jobs@ folder of your application or of any plugin. When creating plugin jobs, the plugin name must be in the job class name, but not the job class file. For example, the @cake_djjob@ plugin contains a @CakeDjjob_TestJob@ in @libs/jobs/test_job.php@. All plugins must be separated from the job classname using an underscore, and there can only be one underscore in a classname. This is so you can use jobs from plugins as well as from the application.

Jobs respond to a @perform()@ method, as in "djjob":http://github.com/seatgeek/djjob. In @cake_djjob@, all jobs should extend the @CakeJob@ class. For example, an application's @EmailJob@ might be composed as follows:

<pre><code><?php
class EmailJob extends CakeJob {

    function perform() {
        $this->out('Some debug output');

        // Using models
        $this->loadModel('Post');
        $count = $this->Post->find('count');

        // Complex email stuff here...
        $this->loadComponent('Email');
        $this->Email->_set(array(
            'to' => 'email@example.com',
            'from' => 'noreply@example.com',
            'subject' => 'Daily Post Statistics',
            'replyTo' => 'noreply@example.com',
            'template' => null,
            'sendAs' => 'both',
        ));
        $this->Email->send(sprintf("There are %n posts", $count));

        // More work involving some api...
        $this->out("Some metrics");
    }

}
?>
</code></pre>

Extending the @CakeJob@ also allows the usage of the following methods:

* @loadModel($modelClass, $id = null)@
** Works exactly as Controller::loadModel() works
* @loadComponent($componentClass)@
** Loads, initializes, and attaches a Component
* @out($message = null, $newlines = 1)@
** Outputs messages to standard out
* @err($message = null, $newlines = 1)@
** Outputs error messages to standard error
* @nl($multiplier = 1, $print = false)@
** Outputs a new line to standard out
* @hr($newlines = 0)@
** Outputs a horizontal rule to standard out

By extending @CakeJob@, you get an instant base off of which writing jobs will be quick and easy.

h3. Enqueuing Jobs

Currently, CakeDJJob only allows users to enqueue Jobs from a Controller/Component. This will be remedied in the future.

For now, you can attach the @CakeDjjob@ Component to your controller like so:

<pre><code><?php
class UsersController extends AppController {
    var $components = array('CakeDjjob.CakeDjjob');

    function forgot_password() {
        if ($user_id = $this->User->forgot($this->data)) {
            App::import('Lib', 'ForgotPasswordJob');
            $this->CakeDjjob->enqueue(new ForgotPasswordJob($user_id));
            $this->Session->setFlash('You will shortly be sent a password reset email :)');
        } else {
            $this->Session->setFlash('There is no such email in our system. Please try again.');
        }
    }
}
?></code></pre>

Note that you'll need a @jobs@ table just like the one included with @djjob@. A @cake_schema@ file is forthcoming.

h3. Running Jobs

Included with this plugin is a task to run jobs.

<pre><code>cake worker run</code></pre>

The above statement will run a single worker on the default queue forever. It can be added to your cron or by some other process manager such as "God":http://god.rubyforge.org/. The following params are available for the worker:

* -connection <config>
** set db config <config>. default config: default
* -type <name>
** pdo name for connection <type>. default type: mysql
* -queue <name>
** queue <name> to pull jobs from. default queue: default
* -count <number>
** run <number> of jobs to run before exiting (0 for unlimited). default count: 0
* -sleep <name>
** sleep <number> seconds after finding no new jobs. default seconds: 5
* -max <number>
** max <number> of retries for a given job. default retries: 5
* -debug <number>
** debug <level> to set for worker. default level: 0

h2. TODO

* Behavior/Task to allow queueing of new jobs from Models/Shells
* Allow alternative methods of plugin prefixing
* Sample EmailJob based off of CakePHP's EmailComponent
* Screencast
* Unit Tests
* Better handling of base CakeJob variables
